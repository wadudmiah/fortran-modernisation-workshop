1. Type 'make' which should build without any problems. If there are any
problems, please contact wadud.miah@nag.co.uk
2. Then type 'make execute' which should create the files fmw_test.png 
which is a PNG image file of sin(x) where 0<= x <= 360
3. Then type 'make ncdump' which should list the values of x and t

If all the above tests worked, then you have the required prerequisite
